# U.S. Medical Insurance Costs Project

In this project, I will be analyzing a dataset related to medical insurance costs in the United States using various data analysis techniques. My aim is to uncover patterns and relationships within the data, investigating factors that might influence medical insurance charges. I'll be utilizing Python and various libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn to perform data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis to gain insights into the dynamics of medical insurance costs and provide valuable information for further analysis and decision-making.

## Project Overview

This notebook is organized into several sections:

1. **Installing Packages:** I'll start by installing the necessary packages using pip to ensure that all the required libraries are available.

2. **Importing Libraries:** Next, I'll import essential Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.

3. **Read Data:** I'll read the insurance dataset from a CSV file and explore its initial structure.

4. **Data Preprocessing:** I'll then convert categorical variables into appropriate data types and check for missing values.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I'll analyze the dataset's summary statistics and visualize data distributions and relationships between variables.

6. **Outlier Detection:** I'll identify potential outliers in specific numerical features using box plots and the interquartile range (IQR).

7. **Exploring Relationships between Variables:** I'll utilize pair plots to visualize relationships between different numerical features.

8. **Hypothesis Testing:** I'll conduct statistical hypothesis tests to examine relationships between variables.

Let's dive into the code and start exploring the dataset!
